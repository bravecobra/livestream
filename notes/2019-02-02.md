# Stream Notes 2019-02-02

## Goal

Investigating hashicorp's nomad usage and basic concepts

### Issues found

- Docker on Windows seems to have a problem mounting volumes when ran through nomad on windows. It tries to spin up a docker containers but gives a mount error

    ```text

    The source path "C:/Users/james/AppData/Local/Temp/NomadClient091936862/e166fb49-8c66-722d-6d48-53c79e9f87a0/alloc:c"
    doesn't exist and is not known to Docker
    ```

  Might be related to [https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3931](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/3931)
  
  Further investigation led to [https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/2633](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/2633) where it's stated that Docker for Windows running linux containers is not supported by nomad currently, so no point in trying to fix this.
- Works perfectly on Linux

## Next stream

- Point the camera lower
- Investigate Hashicorp's Consul
- Noble goal could be animal shelters, but we 'll to gather domain knowledge before embarking on this track
